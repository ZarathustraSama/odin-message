# Odin Message
This is the last project of the React section of The Odin Project, where the barebone of a web app for messaging between user is the main focus. It has not included real time server-client updates, but aside from that, it gets the job done.

I will also add that this project has the bare minimum of the implementations required, as once all of those are functional, it's not that different to add things like polymorphism or a "refresh" update mechanic to at least check if users are online or not. Since I think it would be best to use the same real time server-client update logic mentioned before, I will refrain adding a half-baked solution.
